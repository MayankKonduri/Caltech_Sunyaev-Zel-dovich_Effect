## Refining Mock Observations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect in Massive Galaxy Clusters
- This project aims to reproduce and enhance the analysis of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect presented in a previous thesis. The kSZ effect is an observational method used to study cosmic growth and galaxy cluster formation. This work focuses on specific aspects of the original analysis, particularly noise modeling and contaminant handling.

## Project Goals
- **Reproduce Original Plots**: Recreate the thesis plots using updated software for compatibility and accuracy.
- **Enhance Analysis Pipeline**: Refine the analysis pipeline to improve constraints on galaxy cluster peculiar velocities derived from kSZ data.
- **Inform Future Telescope Design**: Methodologies from this project may provide insights for future kSZ-focused telescope designs.

## Current Progress
1. **Reproducing Thesis Plots**: Recreating the original plots using updated tools and methods.
2. **Internalizing Workflow**: Reviewing the workflow of the original notebooks to understand each step in the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- **Noise Modeling Improvements**: Integrate improved noise modeling to refine results.
- **Contaminant Handling**: Implement better contaminant handling methods to reduce errors in kSZ measurements.
  
These refinements aim to support more precise kSZ observations, providing better constraints on galaxy cluster dynamics and cosmic structure growth.

## Potential Impact
Insights from this project could help in designing future telescopes optimized for kSZ studies, aiding in understanding galaxy cluster formation and the large-scale structure of the universe.
